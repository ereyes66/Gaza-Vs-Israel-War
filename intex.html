<p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/9/whats-the-israel-palestine-conflict-about-a-simple-guide">The Israeli-Palestinian</a> conflict has claimed <b>tens of thousands</b> of lives and displaced many millions of people and has its roots in a colonial act carried out more than a century ago. With Israel <i>declaring war</i> on the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Gaza-Strip">Gaza Strip</a> after an unprecedented <b>attack</b> by the armed Palestinian group Hamas on Saturday, the world's eyes are again sharply focused on what might come next. Hamas fighters have killed more than 800 Israelis in assaults on <i>multiple</i> towns in southern Israel. In response, Israel has launched a <i>bombing</i> campaign in the Gaza Strip, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-01-21-2024-02caafa092668ecc7ff122229c166807">killing more than 500 Palestinians</a>.</p>
    
<p>It has mobilised troops along the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20415675">Gaza border</a>, apparently in <b>preparation</b> for a ground attack. And on Monday, it announced a “total blockade” of the Gaza Strip, stopping the supply of food, fuel and other <b>essential</b> commodities to the already besieged enclave in an act that under international law amounts to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/16/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-war-crimes-international-law-explainer-intl/index.html"><i>war crime</i></a>. But what unfolds in the coming days and weeks has its seed in history. For decades, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-gaza-hamas-photos.html">Western media outlets</a>, academics, military experts and world leaders have described the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as intractable, complicated and <b>deadlocked</b>.</p>

<h3>The wars on the Gaza Strip</h3>
<ol><li>Israel has launched four protracted military assaults on Gaza: in 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021. Thousands of Palestinians have been killed, including many children, and tens of thousands of homes, schools and office buildings have been destroyed.</li>
<li>Rebuilding has been next to impossible because the siege prevents construction materials, such as steel and cement, from reaching Gaza.</li>
<li>The 2008 assault involved the use of internationally banned weaponry, such as phosphorus gas.</li>
<li>In 2014, over a span of 50 days, Israel killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, including 1,462 civilians and close to 500 children.</li>
<li>During the assault, called Operation Protective Edge by the Israelis, about 11,000 Palestinians were wounded, 20,000 homes were destroyed and half a million people displaced.</li>
